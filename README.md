## OVERVIEW

This is a repository of all the couplets, haikus, sonnets and other poems that I have written. I have published some of them in Voicesnet. However, with the passage of timeâ€”as with all things, I have modified my original wordings. In some cases, I have completely rewritten some, modified a few lines, reworded parts and so on.
