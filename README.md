# LITERARY WORKS

<br>

## OVERVIEW

This is a repository of all the couplets, haikus, sonnets and other poems that I have written. I have published some of them in Voicesnet. However, with the passage of timeâ€”as with all things, I have modified my original wordings. In some cases, I have completely rewritten some, modified a few lines, reworded parts and so on.

The folder labeled *haikus* contains haikus, the *sonnets* contains sonnets, and the *random* is to contain
other forms of poem that are neither haikus nor sonnets.
