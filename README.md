## OVERVIEW

This is a repository of all the couplets, haikus, sonnets and other poems that I have written. I have published some of them in Voicesnet. However, with the passage of time—as with all things, I have modified my original wordings. In some cases, I have completely rewritten some, modified a few lines, reworded parts and so on.

## FEATURES

* couplets
    - say what couplets are here and include example screenshot
* haikus
    - According to [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haiku) haiku originated from Japan. To be honest, I started writing haikus after reading a manga—japanese comic, about the shinsengumi. I was impressed with the 5 7 5 style and simplicity. The haiku has 3 lines, the first line is 5 syllables, second is 7 syllables and the third line also 5 syllables. Below is my haiku 1 :-
    ```
        Each day by love's might
        I am gaining a new height
        Than eagles can fly.
    ```
* sonnets
    - say what sonnets are here and include example screenshot
