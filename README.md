## OVERVIEW

This is a repository of all the couplets, haikus, sonnets and other poems that I have written. I have published some of them in Voicesnet. However, with the passage of time—as with all things, I have modified my original wordings. In some cases, I have completely rewritten some, modified a few lines, reworded parts and so on.

## FEATURES

* couplets
    - According to [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Couplet) couplet usually consists of two successive lines that rhyme and have the same metre. It does not have to stand alone like the way I have written them in this repository. It could be any two successive line in a poem that rhymes and have the same metre. The couplet of mine below has a ten syllables metre :-
    ```
        Methinks God is God because He is just,
        And men are not men because they are dust.
    ```
* haikus
    - According to [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haiku) haiku originated from Japan. To be honest, I started writing haikus after reading a manga—japanese comic, about the shinsengumi. I was impressed with the 5 7 5 style and simplicity. The haiku has 3 lines, the first line is 5 syllables, second is 7 syllables and the third line also 5 syllables. Below is my haiku 1 :-
    ```
        Each day by love's might
        I am gaining a new height
        Than eagles can fly.
    ```
* sonnets
    - A sonnet as I know it from reading those of William Shakespeare is a poem of 14 lines with a strict rhyme scheme and structure. You can learn more at [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sonnet). My sonnet_6 demonstrates :-
    ```
        I never considered you a dear friend
        In despite of the times and things we shared
        But now that we each take separate bend
        In this new road, I've come to know I cared.
        For we have walked together for so long
        I no longer know how to walk alone
        'Twas your hand in mine that made me so strong
        To come this far and to climb every stone.
        In this new road, we needs must say g'byes
        Time has decided we cannot appeal
        Distance will take you away from my eyes
        But the you in my heart, nothing can steal.

            Should I glad or sad to know at the end,
            That you in all this time were a dear friend?
    ```
