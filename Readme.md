# LITERARY WORKS

One hobby of mine is to compose sonnets, haikus and other forms of poems. I picked up the habit
after reading the *Complete Works of William Shakespeare* and wrote some sonnets. I am **not** an English and 
Literary Studies Student so you may find that the meter of my sonnets are broken. In that case, feel free to suggest
an edit or clone the repository and make a pull request. I will take a look at it and appreciate it. I will really appreciate any report about typos or information about sonnets.

As for style goes, some of my earliest work bear some semblance to Shakespeare's style. However, with the passage
of time, I came to have a distinct style, if I do say so myself.

The folder labeled *haikus* contains haikus, the *sonnets* contains sonnets, and the *random* is to contain
other forms of poem that are neither haikus nor sonnets.
