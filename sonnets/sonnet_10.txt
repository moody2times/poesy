Lost have I become in her whom I found
That in my tongue and heart there is no me,
Neither can I keep my feet on the ground
For in her, new depth I keep finding still.
New depth in love I find to fall anew
And as I fall in, she gains a new height,
Giving me subject and new point of view
To praise fair with fair learned under love's might.
And since I found her, since I knew her name
Something changed something 'bout my night and day,
I am not different, I am not the same
Love is the reason I am torn this way.

I found love and then start looking for me,
Ah! I am in love and there leave me be.
