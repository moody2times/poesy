Do not after reading compliment me
Because with this ink, here I tell of pain
Nor be moved by these lines to comfort me
'Tis in my friend's heart sorrow still remain.
For too often in the wind of a dream
We spread callow wings and hurry to fly
Forgetting to wake only just to scream
As we break after falling from the sky.
My friend fell from his dream and broke his heart,
A wound to his soul, a deep injury.
Death is to escape, life the bitter part
When night and day will give no remedy.

The fear of falling again robbed his will
To want to stand, thus deeper fell he still.
