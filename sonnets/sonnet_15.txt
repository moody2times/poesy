The rainbow pride in its many colors,
Which can paint beauties both seen and unseen.
But with mine ink I shame in my labors,
Which show Beauty with black ink than with green.
That Beauty has no limit 's my limit
For limit 's the essence that defines me,
Being best a being worst when I stretch my wit:
Making my limit Beauty's limit be.
So may my verse a bastard be at best,
Having Beauty's breath yet no part of it;
And so Beauty's throne should not in it vest,
'Tis wanting of such credit 'pon audit.

Then show no pity, Beauty, in this case,
For pity gives me leave to thee disgrace.
