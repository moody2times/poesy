Your beauty indeed compel me to write
But how can I use little to say much?
Apple of mine eyes, my best is a bite,
A whisper, in all and no more than such.
I shan't paint your beauty with the rainbow
It lasts for a while then hurry to fade,
Such short moment won't all your virtues show;
The rainbow can but example your shade.
Would that mine ink makes your beauty fairer
Much more than the stars would the evening sky,
Or that my verse gives you heights e'en higher
Than the sun can rise or eagles can fly.

In this, your sweet beauty I am praising,
And by so, my love I am declaring.
