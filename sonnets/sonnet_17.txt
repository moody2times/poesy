In daylight I know a darkness within
For the light of my life is not the Sun,
She frowns at me, such frown no light givin'
Than an eclipse that now blocks my love's sun.
O! This eclipse makes my nights seem longer
For my days are black and no morn I see,
The length of my hope in this gets shorter
As this eclipse robs me more days with thee.
Dear love, you slay me daily with this hate
Yet this wound does not wound me as nearly,
That my bond with thee you will terminate
Squeezes the breadth from my heart more quickly.

But if for my faults our bond you unbind,
I shall ne'er love those who say "love is blind".
