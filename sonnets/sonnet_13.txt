But what gain have I in telling anew
Mine argument for both beauty and love,
'Tis that I labour to give better view
And thus move what heart remains unmove'.
For nothing better say I than before
That now love and beauty better reveal,
As new colours, new words do nothing more
Save to give new force to their old appeal.
But methinks I write to try and escape
From cares in my heart and my heart make free,
'Tis not to give love o' beauty better shape
But to compel obsession, release me.

For my telling of you ne'er seem to end,
With new inventions, I mine old praise mend.
