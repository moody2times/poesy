There is one I love but must not confess
So I am burned daily by desire, 
'Tis not fear to fail or doubt of success
But I must not vent my inner fire. 
Neither is my silence for want of words
To give her a window into my heart, 
Though I do not boast a wealth of words
And you may prove me by this piece of art. 
What reason is there for me not to woo
Till she confess to approve of me? 
Except when she smile or pine or coo
It is her sweetheart that she longs to see. 

Here is my grief, her sweetheart is not me, 
I should not confess to what cannot be.
