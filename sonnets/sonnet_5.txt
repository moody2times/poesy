And so there can no wrong be established
Against one lover in the other's court
Love is not right to have a wrong published
Though a lover defaults and come to short.
And dear love even so have I loved thee
My love weigh more on the scale than your wrong,
For this reason, I, reason must needs see
To excuse a wrong to make a bond strong.
For I'm persuaded by both heart and sight
One love too much, the other see to small;
These advocates daily give my love might
To lift thee up as oft as thou may fall.

By so, I tie one more knot to our bond,
To reinforce the first with the second.
