O do not from me turn your eyes away
Y'eyes are lights, you reveal with your looking
When you look at me, I find what to say
As your eyes give light to what I'm feeling.
And nay, the sun has no such bright a light
To make clear how I feel deep in my heart
For when 'tis day my heart will still be night
Till your eyes will play the rising sun's part.
'Tis when I see you that my day begin
For the light of my life is not the sun,
And it's night for me as you are leavin'
For I'd start dreaming of you when you're gone.

So stay, my love, make everyday a day,
For night will not come, if you don't away.
