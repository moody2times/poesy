O my black ink with your might is golden,
Methinks the Sun has no such alchemy
The pride of my verse 's to you beholden;
You are the seat of beauteous poesy.
How I have slept and robbed thee of your praise
Though my want is the wherewithal to pay,
For your debt's too great discharge with phrase;
When phrases are formed from thine own lip's clay.
It befits not poets to of your praise tell,
For they invoke you for their argument
And cannot themselves make your worth excel
By one pace, with what praises they invent.

But if my verse merry made one heart be,
Let that heart's pleasure be what I pay thee.
