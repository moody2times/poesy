But what else are my verses than window
For you dear love to look into my heart
And see the love that the sweetly words show
Although they show not all of it but part.
For my love's deeper than the depth of words
Therefore with words I give but estimate;
So look dear love behind my gentle words
You'll see love greater than what I state.
And methinks I have a bottomless heart
Else how is it that I love you so much
Than numbers can count? If numbers fit th' part
To measure my love or judge it as such.

But look now, dear love, deep into my heart
For I give you window with this fine art.
