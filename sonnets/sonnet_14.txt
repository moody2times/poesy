O posterity! Would you were awake,
But alack! you slumber still in Time's womb
So you cannot of this fair view partake,
Which when you wake, shall lie waste in Time's tomb.
And so charge I my verse with this duty,
That when Time sack this fair, it should give breath
To keep alive the fair of this beauty 
So that it may be found and thus cheat death.
