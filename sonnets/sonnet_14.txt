O posterity! Would you were awake,
But alack! you slumber still in Time's womb
So you cannot of this fair view partake,
Which when you wake shall lie waste in Time's tomb.
And so charge I my verse with this duty,
That when Time sack this fair, it should give breath,
So all that's lost by this 
Shall be found
