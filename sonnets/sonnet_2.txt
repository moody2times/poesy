What gain have I in singing my own praise?
Such has no motion to give me new height.
Spectator's approval do give a raise,
And in that alone am I given flight.
What god or man can well his own praise tell
If such does not translate to vainglory.
And methinks in self-praise there no worth dwell,
Nothing better meaning than self-sorry.
For can anyone spectate their own show?
They being the actors, others do give view
Who the ills and wells of such show can know
And from that account give th' actor his due.

If I take from myself to pay myself,
What have I more than that I had at first?
