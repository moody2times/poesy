I never considered you a dear friend
In despite of the times and things we shared
But now that we each take separate bend
In this new road, I've come to know I cared.
For we have walked together for so long
I no longer know how to walk alone
'Twas your hand in mine that made me so strong
To come this far and to climb every stone.
In this new road, we needs must say g'byes
Time has decided we cannot appeal
Distance will take you away from my eyes
But the you in my heart, nothing can steal.

Should I glad or sad to know at the end,
That you in all this time were a dear friend?
