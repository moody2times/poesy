If I could paint your beauty with the rainbow
I would with each colour, colour each grace,
Blue eyes, golden hair, and your smiles yellow
Till I spend each colour telling your face.
One to another your colours agree
To make one beauty with many virtues;
One star ne'er made the night sky fairly,
But a constellation uses beauty's hues.
If the earth is earth and heaven heaven
The reason for the divide being beauty,
Then by you, heaven and earth is even
For your beauty bridge the disparity.

But earth is dust, I judge beauty no such,
Earth is plain clay, beauty is heaven's touch.
