Where is that star that influences the birth
Of my verses with worthy argument,
There's in the sky for many nights a dearth
I have subjects but lack the complement.
And by this dearth, my ink is decaying,
Methinks my Muse bless another's subject
Who her praise better attention paying
Him winning her love and me her neglect.
And so in this I am now dismaying
That I lose that Might which gives my verse pride;
And I say so much yet not much saying
In that I invent, with my Muse beside.

As night is black without moon or star light,
So black's my verse without my Muse's might.
