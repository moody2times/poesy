Your beauty, my love, is as the rainbow
A beauty unique, born of many hues,
Each hue with its virtue your beauty show
Summing your beauty with many virtues.
As with rainbow, so's your beauty timeless,
Or as the wine increase value with age;
And though Time will steal from sweet things sweetness,
Your beauty will stand with Time as its stage.
My love, in your beauty no fault is found
But I fear, my love, my telling of you,
I may show fault in you as tongues are bound
And disgrace you, though, meaning to praise you.

But mine is your praise and never disgrace,
Were mortal tongues made steadfast in that place.
