I am compelled to write a verse for thee,
Not for gain, though, to write is a reward  
Because your beauty will then instruct me
To recount your fair; by a hand too awkward.
Your beauty, deeper than the depths of words,
Exceed all the grace that words can reference.
And all the sense and image fair words affords
Are poor imitation of your excellence.
As heaven's name in the heart of men seem
The author of beauty and for so translate,
So I your beauty for ethereal deem:
Being not of earth, earth cannot estimate.

I meant this to praise, do not take offense.
But if you must, let love be my defense.
