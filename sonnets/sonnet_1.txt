I am compelled to write a verse for thee,
Not for gain,  
But then your beauty indeed instruct me
To take up my pen to count 
Your beauty, deeper than the depth of words,
Exceeds all the sum that words can reference

Be poor imitation of your excellence.
As heaven's name in the heart of men seem
The author of beauty and for so translate,
So I your beauty for ethereal deem:
Being not of earth, earth cannot estimate.

I meant this to praise, do not take offense.
But if you must, let love be my defense.
